### Map view

A map is displayed to show you starting and end points of the available trips.

### Gamification

Your booking results in **5 points** which will be added under your name to the Highscore list. Be aware that your name needs to 100% match, if it is not your first offering to be accumulated to the same person on the Highscore list.
