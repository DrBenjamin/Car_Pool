# Hitchhiking

The **Hitchhiking** menu let's you find planned trips.

## Find a trip

Under the menu **Hitchhiking** you can find the following selections:

- Range start: *to select the date of the trip you are looking for*
- Range end: *to select the end date of the range if you are flexible to choose of several days of traveling*
  (Choose twice the same to just look for a trip on one particular day!)
- Departure: *to select the starting point of the trip you are looking for*
- Destination: *to select the ending point of the trip you are looking for*
- Female driver: *to select if you are looking for a female driver*
- Only female guests: *to choose if the trip is just for female guests*

If you don't find a trip try to change the parameters slightly (for instance choose an alternate date).
